# Information
If you can read this message, the plugin is not yet ready. Until the first version is released, this repository is solely for people who might be interested in the development of this plugin.

## Currently (partly) working features:
 - Importing region selections from WorldEdit
 - Command to "blockify" the selected polygon
 - Debug command to create a simple shape marker from the current selection (will be replaced by a customizable region creation command)
